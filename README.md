# Stopwatch-using-React
A stopwath application using react where you can also take count of the laps.
1. After you create your react app using "npx create-react-app app_name" in the terminal just delete your src folder and copy it from here.
2. After that call your working folder by "cd app_name".
3. All good!! you are ready to start your development server using "npm start".
Hope everything works fine:)
